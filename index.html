        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>On the nalo network, we desire to incentivize all aspects of the "earthcare," "people care," and "fairshare" movements that are the foundational ethics of Permaculture. We do this to ensure that nature always lives on!</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Through the connection of humans to their inherent gifts that they wish to offer/share, we will build a network of landsites we call "living libraries."</p>
        <p>"Through the sharing of our gifts, we will create the abundance that is inherent in a balanced, naturally occurring organism."</p>
